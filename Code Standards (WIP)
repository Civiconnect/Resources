- Use Copilot (Student plan available)
- Tabs not Spaces
- Every project should have a .prettierrc config file
- Write comments
  - For every new component, document what the props are (if applicable), what the component does, how it should be used, etc.
  - When writing functions, write 1 or 2 lines briefly explaining what the function does and what it's used for
  - In general, comments should be focused on *why* something works a certain way, rather what *what* it does specifically.
- Destructured props are preferred
- Use whitespace (empty lines) to separate code, where appropriate
- Use Font Awesome Icons for any icons.  The inline version ```<i className="fa-solid fa-house"></i>``` is preferred over the React Component version, but either is acceptable.  Do not use inline SVGs unless necessary.
- Use TODO: notation to highlight pieces of code that are partially implemented and need to be finished later
- Any commits that fix an issue should reference the issue using "Fixes #123" notation to automatically close the issue
- Share any env variables in a password-protected file within the project channel in Teams.
- Only install packages that have been approved by your Team Lead, and when new packages are added, make note of it in your commit message
- camelCase for variable names (code), and SnakeCase for strapi fields.
- Components should have only one return value
- Make sure you're working with the same Node version as your teammates.
- Install react snippets and use the "rfc" snippet when creating new components.
- Functional components only, class-based components should only be used if absolutely necessary.
- Remove all console.logs when you commit and push your code
